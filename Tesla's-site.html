    <p> This puppy is yawning. He is super cute. I have an Australian Shepard dog but I don't have any pictures of him as a puppy because we rescued him when he was older.
    So this is what I imagine he looks like </p>

    <p> Or he might look closer to this puppy, excepy my dog only has one eye that has a spot over it. </p>
